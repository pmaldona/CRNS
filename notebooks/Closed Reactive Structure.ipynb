Then it is verified if each of these union-closure corresponds to a synergy and if the resulting set is semi-self-maintained or an organization. Then this operation is repeated recursively with the generated sets, until all the reactive closures are obtained. This structure is known as synergic structure [link to paper](), and is generated by the `setSynStr()` function. This function generates a multigraph object `networkx`, where the nodes correspond to all reactive closed sets and their edges to unions-closure. The properties of the nodes account for whether the set is semi-self-maintained and/or self-maintained. While the edges whether the union-closure corresponds to a synergy or not.
